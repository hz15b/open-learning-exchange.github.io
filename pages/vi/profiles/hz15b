I'm a current PhD candidate in materials science & engineering program in Florida State University. I'm mainly studying the computatutional
materials science. I love coding and am looking forward to learning knowledges of computer science. I took some basic computer science courses
including object-oriented c/c++, data structure, operating system etc. And I learned python by myself.

I'm looking forward to getting to know more stuff about website development, coding, Raspberry Pi etc.
